I am a first-year PhD candidate at Hasso-Platner Institute, University of Potsdam, working under the supervision of [Prof. Christoph Lippert](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RVl8TE0AAAAJ&hl=en). I am part of the the [European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS)](https://ellis.eu/) PhD cohort 2024. I have a background in Machine Learning and Biomedical Engineering and currently work at the intersection of both fields. My research interests include vision-language models, generative models and continual learning with particular applications in medical imaging domain. I am currently interested in learning about the genomics basis of the phenotypes using Deep Learning. Feel free to reach out if this sounds interesting to you. You can find my resume [here](https://aneesurhashmi.github.io/files/resume.pdf).


<!-- I am a Research Scientist and Manager at **[Google Zurich](https://research.google/people/FedericoTombari/)** (Switzerland), where I lead an applied research team in Computer Vision and Machine Learning across Mountain View, Zurich and Munich. I am also affiliated to the [Faculty of Computer Science](https://www.in.tum.de/startseite/) at **TU Munich** (Germany) as [lecturer](https://www.in.tum.de/campar/members/senior-research-scientists/federico-tombari/) (Privatdozent).  -->

<!-- An up-to-date list of publications is available at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=TFsE4BIAAAAJ&hl=en). My research activity has been mostly focused on different aspects of **3D computer vision**, such as 3D scene understanding, 3D object recognition, 3D reconstruction/modeling, SLAM. The fields of application of my research are mainly in **robotics, augmented reality, autonomous driving and healthcare**. I am currently particularly excited about unsupervised learning for visual data, Large Multimodal Models, neural radiance fields and scene graphs for scene understanding.  -->
